Plates Mobile's frontend runs on [Svelte v4](https://svelte.dev/), a minimalist webapp framework. Simple.
Behind it all is [Nativescript](https://nativescript.org/) for interacting with your device, and [transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index) for running models on-device.
